                his films—The Royal Tenenbaums, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest

                <b>Visual style</b><br>
                Anderson has been noted for his extensive use 
                of flat space camera moves, obsessively 
                symmetrical compositions, knolling, 
                snap-zooms, slow-motion walking shots, 
                a deliberately limited color palette, 
                and hand-made art direction often utilizing miniatures.
                These stylistic choices give his movies a highly distinctive 
                quality that has provoked much discussion, critical study, 
                supercuts, and mash-ups, and even parody. Many writers, critics, 
                and even Anderson himself, have commented that this gives his movies 
                the feel of being <q>self-contained worlds</q>, or a <q>scale model household</q>. 
                According to Jesse Fox Mayshark, his films have "a baroque pop bent 
                that is not realist, surrealist or magic realist", but rather might be described as <q>fabul[ist]</q>.<br>
                From The Life Aquatic on, Anderson has relied more heavily on stop 
                motion animation and miniatures, even making entire features with 
                stop motion animation with Fantastic Mr. Fox and Isle of Dogs.
